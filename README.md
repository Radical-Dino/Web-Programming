# Web-Programming

I made web pages on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# About the Projects

[Rad Homepage](https://codepen.io/hunterjustin/pen/GLeNrN)

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a homepage.

There is a navigation bar and some dropdowns.

The webpage even changes if you are using a phone or a computer.

In the project, there are links to my other CodePen projects or Scratch projects.
