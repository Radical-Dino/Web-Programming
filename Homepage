# Web-Programming

https://codepen.io/hunterjustin/pen/GLeNrN

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make a homepage.
I put all the things I have learnt into that homepage.
I put a navigation bar, some dropdowns, thumbnails for the other websites
and changes in the page if you are on phone or computer.
There are links to other of my projects inside the page.

The projects include:
Scratch Projects
CodePen Projects
